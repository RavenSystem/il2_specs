Operation features:  
- The engine has a two-stage mechanical supercharger which must be manually switched at 1200...1600m altitude.  
- Engine mixture control is manual; it is necessary to lean the mixture if altitude is more than 3-4 km for optimal engine operation. Also, leaning the mixture allows a reduction in fuel consumption during flight.  
- Engine RPM has an automatic governor and it is maintained at the required RPM corresponding to the governor control lever position. The governor automatically controls the propeller pitch to maintain the required RPM.  
- Oil radiator shutters are controlled manually.  
- Water radiator shutters can be controlled automatically and manually.  
- The airplane can only be trimmed in the pitch axis.  
- Landing flaps have a pneumatic actuator. Flaps can only be fully extended; gradual extending is impossible. Due to the weak force of the actuator the extended landing flaps may be pressed upwards by the airflow if the airspeed is more than 220 km/h. Remember that the flaps will not extend fully in case of high speed. In case of a high-speed landing approach the flaps may extend a few steps further right before landing.  
- The aircraft has differential pneumatic wheel brakes with shared control lever. This means that if the brake lever is held and the rudder pedal the opposite wheel brake is gradually released causing the plane to swing to one side or the other.  
- Fuel gauges are installed on left and right wing fuel tanks, outside of the cockpit. The central feeder tank (20 litres) capacity is not measured.  
- It is impossible to open the canopy at high speeds because of the ram air, but there is an emergency jettison handle for bailing out.  
- The tailwheel rotates freely, but moving the control stick back locks it in the central (“flight-oriented”) position.  
  
Basic data and recommended positions of the aircraft controls:  
1. Starting the engine:  
	- recommended position of the mixture control lever: 100%  
	- recommended position of the radiators control handles: close  
	- recommended position of the prop pitch control handle: 100%  
	- recommended position of the throttle lever: 5%  
  
2. Recommended mixture control lever positions for various flight modes:  
	- When running the engine at low throttle near the ground, the mixture control lever should be in the position of about 50%.  
	- When the engine is running at full throttle near the ground, the mixture control lever should be in the 75-80% position.  
	- As you gain altitude, the altitude corrector closes. At 8-9 km altitude, the altitude corrector closes to 0%.  
  
3.1 Recommended positions of the oil radiator control handle for various flight modes:  
	- takeoff: open 100%  
	- climb: open 100%  
	- cruise flight: open 30%  
	- combat: open 100%  
  
3.2 Recommended positions of the water radiator control handle for various flight modes:  
	- takeoff: open 100%  
	- climb: open 100%  
	- cruise flight: open 40%  
	- combat: open 80%  
  
4. Approximate fuel consumption at 2000 m altitude:  
	- Cruise engine mode: 7.5 l/min
