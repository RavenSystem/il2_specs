Operation features:  
- The engines have a boost mode. To set boost mode it is necessary to push the boost lever fully forward and increase the engine M-62 to 2200 RPM and the engine M-63 to 2230 RPM.  
- The engines have a two-stage mechanical supercharger which should be manually shifted at 2500m altitude for M-62 engine and at 3000m altitude for M-63 engine.  
- Engine mixture control is automatic when the mixture lever is set to maximum. It is possible to manually lean the mixture by moving the mixture control to less than maximum. This also reduces fuel consumption during flight.  
- Engine RPM has an automatic governor and it is maintained at the required RPM corresponding to the governor control lever position. The governor automatically controls the propeller pitch to maintain the required RPM.  
- Oil radiator shutter and air cooling intake shutters control is manual.  
- The aircraft has no flight-control trimmers. Airplane is equipped with bendable trim tabs that can be set pre-flight by ground personnel.  
- The aircraft has a tailwheel control mechanism which is linked to rudder pedals. Because of this, it is necessary to avoid of large rudder pedal inputs when moving at high speed on the ground.  
- The aircraft has differential pneumatic wheel brakes with shared control lever. This means that if the brake lever is held and the rudder pedal the opposite wheel brake is gradually released causing the plane to swing to one side or the other. To brake the wheels, move the pedals to the neutral position and press the brake lever located on the flight stick. If the pedals are not in neutral position, only one wheel will be braked. If the right pedal is in the forward position, the right wheel will be braked and vice versa, if the left pedal is in the forward position, the left wheel will be braked.  
- The aircraft has a hydrostatic fuel gauge which shows total fuel remaining only when manual sucker lever is pushed in. In game this happens by pressing (RShift+I by default).  
- Cockpit has side-doors which should be closed before takeoff to prevent damage.  
- The aircraft is equipped with a bomb salvo controller, it has three release modes: single drop, drop two in a salvo or drop four in a salvo.  
- The aircraft is equipped with a rockets salvo controller, it has three launch modes: single fire, fire two in a salvo or fire four in a salvo.  
- The gunsight has a sliding sun-filter. There is also a back-up folding mechanical sight which can be used if main sight is damaged.  
- There is no radio station in the default aircraft configuration. As a modification, the installation of the RSI-3 radio station is provided.  
- Full fuel tank capacity is 316 liters (237 kg of petrol). Normal fuel load is 200 liters (150 kg).
