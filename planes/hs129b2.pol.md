Operation features:  
- Controlling the propellers RPM is possible only in the manual mode by changing the propeller pitch. The automatic mode keeps the RPM at 2750.  
- The engine control lever allows setting the pressure up to the combat mode (1.25 ATA).  
- To switch the engines to the take-off mode, move the boost lever to 1.5 ATA position and set the propellers to 3030 RPM.  
- Engine mixture control is automatic. Leaning the mixture manually reduces the fuel consumption during flight.  
- The oil radiator shutters are controlled automatically and dont have a manual mode.  
- The propellers have a feathering system which should be activated in case of engine damage to reduce drag of the propeller in auto-rotation.  
- The aircraft has only pitch and yaw flight-control trimmers.  
- The aircraft has independent left and right hydraulic wheel brake controls. To apply either brake push the upper part of the rudder pedal.  
- Landing flaps have a hydraulic actuator and they can be extended to any angle up to 40° or to the fixed take-off position.  
- The tail wheel rotates freely and does not have a lock. For this reason, it is necessary to confidently and accurately operate the rudder pedals during the takeoff and landing.  
- The aircraft fuel gauges are positioned directly on the engine nacelles and show only the amount of fuel remaining in the wing tanks (the fuel remaining in the central fuel tank is not indicated).  
- The aircraft isnt equipped with an oxygen supply system, so flying above 4000 meters is forbidden.  
- The aircraft is equipped with an electric bomb release controller that allows dropping the bombs only one by one.  
- The gunsight has a sliding sun-filter.
