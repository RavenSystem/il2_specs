# Sopwith Triplane

## 描述

Sopwith engineer Herbert Smith, in designing the Triplane, elected to rectify the lack of manoeuvrability and visibility in previous aircraft designs with the well-known triplane scheme. The three narrow-chord wings provided an increase in airspeed and improved the field of view from the cockpit. Furthermore, the three wings provided an outstanding climb rate and allowed for the compact placement of pilot, fuel tanks, armament, and engine.

The first test flight was performed on May 26, 1916. In addition to Sopwith, aircraft were also manufactured by Clayton & Shuttleworth Ltd. and Lincoln Oakley Ltd. However, a contract with France was soon agreed to that would supply British squadrons with SPAD VII fighters, thus ending the demand for Triplanes. About 180 Sopwith Triplanes in all were manufactured.

The first field tests were conducted by No. 1 (Naval) Squadron in June 1916, which were followed by minor design improvements. Full rearmament of RNAS squadrons was completed by the end of 1916. Until the middle of 1917, Triplanes were armed with only one Vickers machine gun. British pilots noted that the Germans preferred to avoid combat and turned away when spotting the unique image of the Sopwith Triplane. The Triplane was successfully employed against balloons and fighters, in addition to the escort role.

Pilots reported that the plane exhibited an outstanding climb rate, high speed and fair manoeuvrability. They noted that the controls were light and effective, and the rudder was well-balanced. During the summer of 1917, No. 10 (Naval) Squadron’s “Black Flight” claimed 87 German aircraft destroyed for the loss of just one Triplane. These aircraft were also employed by the French Navy, and in 1917, one was transferred to Russia for evaluation. The Sopwith Triplane was deployed to the Western Front and Macedonia.
