## Description  
  
The Nieuport 17 was intended to be a further development of the Nieuport 11 fighter. In comparison to its predecessor, it had a larger wingspan and surface area. In addition, a more powerful engine was fitted, which led to modifications of its engine cowling. Furthermore, it was fitted with a Vickers machine gun that was mounted in front of the cockpit and metal aileron control wires. The lower wing continued to carry one spar and the top one two spars, the so-called “one-and-a-half wings” design. The plane was initially manufactured in several French factories, but licenses were soon purchased by other countries: Great Britain, Russia, Italy, Finland, and Japan. In all, 7200 planes were built with the Le Rhone engine.  
The first mention of its combat appearance is in May 1916, with its equipping of the French N57 squadron. It was used for engaging balloons, bombers and fighters. Pilots noted its good climb speed and visibility and its excellent manoeuvrability. The introduction of the Vickers machine gun was met with ambiguity. Some pilots removed and replaced it with a Lewis machine gun mounted on the upper wing. Others, however, used both machine guns simultaneously, although this somewhat decreased manoeuvrability.  
The plane’s powerful engine and high diving speed exposed the main drawback of the “one-and-a-half wings” design – a weak lower wing due to only one spar. There are two known occasions when pilots made successful landings after losing their lower wings.
