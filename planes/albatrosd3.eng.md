Having investigated the construction of captured Nieuport fighter aircraft, German engineers designed the lower wing of their new plane to be narrower and shorter than the upper one. The wing tips were swept in an effort to eliminate wing vibration. Among other remarkable design solutions, the following can be mentioned: the aileron control rods were drawn through the lower wing, the radiator was moved from the side of the fuselage to the middle of the upper wing, and the wings were now supported by V-shaped struts. Weight reduction was one of the primary tasks for this particular aircraft.  
  
Test flights began in late August or early September 1916 and in December the plane was first delivered to fighter squadrons. Several months of combat action revealed that the plane had a tendency to lose its lower wing in a steep dive or in a sharp turn. Water from the radiator, which was fitted on the upper wing, would spill onto the machine guns, thus making firing impossible. The radiator was relocated to the right side of the pilot in order to correct this problem. From June 1917, engineers began using Daimler’s new cellular radiator, which helped to solve problems with the engine overheating.  
  
The plane was manufactured by Albatros Werke and Ostdeutsche Albatros Werke. The high production rate of the Albatros D.III (1346 built in total) resulted in numerical superiority for German aviation in April 1917.  
  
The Albatros D.III was employed against both enemy balloons and aircraft and used as an escort for bombers and scout planes. Pilots noted the excellent view from the cockpit, good controllability, and high speed and climb rate. The flight characteristics of the plane improved once the new Mercedes D. IIIa engine was mounted, which allowed the plane to remain in frontline service through the autumn of 1918. These machines took part in battles on the Western and the Palestinian Fronts.
