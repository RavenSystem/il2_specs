## 描述  

The Airco D.H.2 was a single-seat fighter and the second project of designer Sir Geoffrey de Havilland. With this design, he capitalized on the development of the "pusher" propeller concept, where the propeller is situated behind the pilot. This design eliminated the need for a synchronised machine gun, which was introduced only at the end of 1916: the prototype of the D.H.2 made its first flight in July 1915. In February 1916, No. 24 Squadron of the Royal Flying Corps became the first unit to be equipped with the type, when it began active service in France.  
  
The Lewis machine gun was mounted in a nacelle and was initially difficult to aim. The movable gun mount forced the pilot to simultaneously control the aircraft and aim the machine gun by hand, which made combat even more difficult. Later on, pilots began to lock the gun down in a fixed position pointing forward. As a result, pilots could aim the weapon by manoeuvring the aircraft, which was found to be more effective than attempting to aim the machine gun manually during combat.  
  
The D.H.2 was often criticised for the complex procedures needed to master the aircraft and the quick reactions demanded by the controls. Even so, all of this made for an outstanding fighter in the hands of experienced pilots. With the introduction of the D.H.2, the RFC gained air superiority over the formerly feared - but now rapidly outdated - Fokker monoplanes, especially during the first Battle of the Somme. The Allied air forces\ resulting domination lasted until the autumn of 1916, at which time the German Albatros D.I and D.II fighters were introduced.  
  
By the end of 1916, the Airco D.H.2 was being withdrawn from combat service. Almost all remaining aircraft had been transferred to training squadrons by the middle of 1917, where they remained in service until the beginning of 1918. Several aircraft remained in service in Palestine and on the Macedonian front until the end of 1917. Not a single unit survived the end of WWI.
