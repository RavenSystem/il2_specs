Operation features:  
- The engine has a two-stage mechanical supercharger which must be manually switched at 3700m altitude.  
- Engine mixture control is manual, it is necessary to lean the mixture if altitude is more than 3-4 km for optimal engine operation. Also, leaning the mixture allows a reduction in fuel consumption during flight.  
- Engine RPM has an automatic governor and it is maintained at the required RPM corresponding to the governor control lever position. The governor automatically controls the propeller pitch to maintain the required RPM.  
- Water radiator shutter control is manual. Oil radiator shutter is fixed.  
- The aircraft has trimmers for all flight-controls: pitch, roll and yaw.  
- Landing flaps have a hydraulic actuator and they can be extended to any angle up to 60°.  
- The aircraft has a manual tailwheel lock. Wheel should be locked when taxiing straight for a long distance and before takeoff and landing.  
- The aircraft has differential pneumatic wheel brakes with shared control lever. This means that if the brake lever is held and the rudder pedal the opposite wheel brake is gradually released causing the plane to swing to one side or the other.  
- The aircraft has a fuel gauge which shows total remaining fuel.  
- Cockpit canopy has a weak lock when in the opened position, for this reason the canopy may spontaneously close in a deep dive. It is impossible to open or close the canopy at high speed due to strong airflow. The canopy has no emergency release, so bail out requires the speed drop before it.  
- When rockets are installed there is a salvo controller, it has three launch modes: single fire, fire two in a salvo or fire four in a salvo.  
  
Basic data and recommended positions of the aircraft controls:  
1. Starting the engine:  
	- recommended position of the mixture control lever: 100%  
	- recommended position of the water radiator control handle: close  
	- recommended position of the prop pitch control handle: 100%  
	- recommended position of the throttle lever: 10%  
  
2. Recommended mixture control lever positions for various flight modes:  
	- When running the engine at low throttle near the ground, the mixture knob should be in the position of about 50%.  
	- When the engine is running at full throttle near the ground, the mixture knob should be in the 75-80% position.  
	- As you gain altitude, you will need to adjust the fuel mixture. At 8-9 km altitude, the mixture lever should be at 0%.  
  
3. Recommended positions of the water radiator control handle for various flight modes:  
	- takeoff: open 100%  
	- climb: open 100%  
	- cruise flight: open 50%  
	- combat: open 80%  
  
4. Approximate fuel consumption at 2000 m altitude:  
	- Cruise engine mode: 2.7 l/min
